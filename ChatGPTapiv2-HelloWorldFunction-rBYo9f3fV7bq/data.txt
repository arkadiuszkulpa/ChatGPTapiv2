Arkadiusz Kulpa CV

Experienced Integration Test Engineer and Test lead currently working within a complex architecture as the company merges new functionality and data with its bespoke software solution. 
I am also studying a level 7 Higher Apprenticeship in Artificial Intelligence Data Specialist with aim to keep implementing ever more innovative solutions to business problems. 
If this Summary is all you will read then simply remember this:
1.	I love asking â€˜Whyâ€™ and understanding the first principles to develop solutions.
2.	I take own initiative and work best when given responsibility AND ownership over a task. I am perfectly capable of figuring out my own priorities, picking the best way forward and organising my teamâ€™s workload (all the while keeping my line manager in the loop).
3.	I can learn any technology needed to carry out a given task, I am deeply technical, love programming and solving complex problems.

WORK EXPERIENCE
Functional Tester		   		             (2022 - present) 
EQUINITI / WORTHING

â€¢ Integration tested a complex Transitional Architecture linking a legacy system undergoing migration with a new bespoke software solution (mainly API calls using SoapUI and WCF Client). 
â€¢ Took charge of own onboarding to describe processes that were not documented or standardised, thereby creating a 160 page and 24 000 word compendium that contains everything needed for anyone to learn the workstream. 
â€¢ Standardised test preparation process by creating automated test prep templates that utilised the patterns found in the requirement documents to define core requirements for each type of test (De-integration, Middle Layer, FaÃ§ade, etc)
â€¢ Created an SQL Query Repository, by saving and organising all SQL queries that I wrote. The repository was tagged so that users can search for any query by Functional requirement, by Deintegration field or by business logic it covers
â€¢ Maximised use of Azure Dev Ops to aid Test Management, by creating critical queries that complement the Excel based Test Schedule used within the department. Next I automated the Test Schedule reducing the manual labour required to bare minimum.
